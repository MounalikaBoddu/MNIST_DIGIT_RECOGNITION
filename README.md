# MNIST_DIGIT_RECOGNITION
This project builds a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes an interactive web interface powered by **Streamlit** where users can test the model on actual MNIST test images.  --- 
Features 
✅ Trains a CNN on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 test images)
✅ Uses Streamlit to provide an interactive UI
✅ Visualizes the selected digit and the model’s prediction
✅ Displays the probability distribution across all digits (0–9)
